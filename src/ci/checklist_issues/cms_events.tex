\item \textbf{C5} The method name at L64 is not a verb. constant at L62 does not follow the naming convention, because it is written in lower case.
\item \textbf{C7} The constant at L62 does not follow the naming convention, because it is written in lower case.
\item \textbf{C8} After the else statement at L121, the indentation is incorrect until L332, because there 4 spaces less.

	\item "error": 7;
	\item "WebSiteContent": 5;
