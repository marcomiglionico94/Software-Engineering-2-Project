In this chapter we provide a detailed description of the individual test cases to be executed on each pair of components that have to be integrated.

Each test case is identified with a code and is directly mapped with Table 2.1 for the integration between components and with Table 2.2 for the integration between subsystems.
Test cases whose code starts with SI are integration tests between subsystems, while test cases whose code starts with I are integration tests between components.

For each method we are going to provide a brief description of the input values and the corresponding expected effects on the system.
