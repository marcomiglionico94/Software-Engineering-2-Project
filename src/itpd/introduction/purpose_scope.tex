\section{Purpose and Scope}
This document is the Integration Test Plan Document (ITPD) for the PowerEnJoy
software. Its purpose is to determine how to accomplish the
integration test of the software, which tools need to be used and which approach
will be followed.
Integration testing is fundamental activity to guarantee that all the different subsystems of PowerEnjoy interoperate,consistently with the requirements they are supposed to fulfil and without unexpected behaviours.
In the following sections we are going to provide:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of the subsystems and their subcomponents involved in the integration activity that will be tested;
\item The criteria that must be met by the project status before integration testing of the outlined elements may begin;
\item A description of the integration testing approach and the reasoning behind it;
\item The sequence in which the different subsystems will be integrated;
\item A description of the planned testing activities for each integration step, including their input data and the expected output;
\item Some performance measures that should be performed on the subsystems to check that they are fulfilling the requirements;
\item A list of all the tools that will have to be employed during the testing activities, together with a description of the operational environment in which the tests will be executed.
\end{itemize}
