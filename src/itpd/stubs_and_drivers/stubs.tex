\section{Stubs}
Despite the bottom-up approach we think it is important to develop a stub: the car stub.
\subsection{Car Stub}
This stub will mimic a car of the PowerEnjoy service. During testing, when the system will need a piece of data of a car (such as car status or the battery level) this stub will be called. In this way, we will speed up the first part of the testing phase, making the testing of the system independent from the state of the Handycar System and onboard tablet implementation.
