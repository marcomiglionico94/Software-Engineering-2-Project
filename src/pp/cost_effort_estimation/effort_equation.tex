\subsection{Effort equation}
This final equation gives us the effort estimation measured in Person-Months (PM):
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC$^E$
\end{lstlisting}
where:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	A = 2.94 (for COCOMO II.2000) 
	EAF = product of all cost drivers (1.1855)
	E = exponent derived from the scale drivers. It is computed as:
		B + 0.01 * $\sum_{i} SF[i]$ = B + 0.01 * 13.63 = 0.91 + 0.1363 = 1.0463
		in which B is equal to: 0.91 for COCOMO II.
\end{lstlisting}

With this parameters we can compute the effort value, which has a lower bound of:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC$^E$ = 2.94 * 1.1855 * 8418$^{1.0463}$ = 44.586 PM $\approx$ 45 PM
\end{lstlisting}
and an upper bound of:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	Effort = A * EAF * KSLOC$^E$ = 2.94 * 1.1855 * 12261$^{1.0463}$ = 66.081 PM $\approx$ 66 PM
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Schedule estimation}
Regarding the final schedule, we are going to use the following formula:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	Duration = 3.67 * Effort$^F$
\end{lstlisting}
As a lower bound, we consider
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	F = 0.28 + 0.2 * (E - B) = 0.28 + 0.2 * 0.1363 = 0.30726
	Effort = 44.586 PM 
	Duration = 3.67 * (44.586)$^{0.30726}$ = 11.79 months
\end{lstlisting}
while as an upper bound, we consider
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, numbers=none]
	F = 0.28 + 0.2 * (E - B) = 0.28 + 0.2 * 0.1363 = 0.30726
	Effort = 66.081 PM 
	Duration = 3.67 * (66.081)$^{0.30726}$ = 13.30 months
\end{lstlisting}
which seem to be both reasonable estimates.
