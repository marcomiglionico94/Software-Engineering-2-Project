\section{External Inquiries (EQs)}
External Inquiry (EQ) represents an elementary process with both input and output components that result in data retrieval from one or more internal logical files and external interface files.
There must be no significant elaboration of data from logic files.

Our system supports the following EQs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consulting history of the rides;
	\item Get info about a given car identified by its plate, like the model, the number of passengers and so on;
	\item Retrieve the list of all the safe areas;
	\item Retrieve the list of all the power grid stations;
	\item Retrieve the actual values of the sensors and actuators of a given car.
\end{itemize}

The resulting table is the following:

\begin{fpcounttable}{EQ}
Consult ride history & Low & 2 \\
Get car info & Low & 2 \\
Retrieve list of safe areas & Low & 2 \\
Retrieve list of power grid stations & Low & 2 \\
Retrieve car sensors and actuators & Low & 2 \\\hline 
\fptotal{10}	
\end{fpcounttable}
