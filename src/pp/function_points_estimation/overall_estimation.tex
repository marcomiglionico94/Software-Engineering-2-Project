\section{Overall estimation}
The following table summarizes the results of our estimation activity:

\begin{fptotaltable}
	Internal Logic Files & 64 \\
	External Logic Files & 22 \\
	External Inputs & 77 \\
	External Inquiries & 10 \\
	External Outputs & 10 \\\hline
	Total & 183\\\hline
\end{fptotaltable}

Relying on the QSM Function Point Languages Table v5.0 and considering Java Enterprise Edition as a development platform, leaving the aspects related to the implementation of the mobile applications (which can be thought as pure presentation with no business logic), in the following we can estimate the total number of lines of code.

Average approximation:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0]
	SLOC = 183 * 46 = 8418
\end{lstlisting}
Upper bound:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0]
	SLOC = 183 * 67 = 12261	
\end{lstlisting}
