\section{External Logic Files (ELFs)}

External Interface Files (EIF) represent a user identifiable group of logically related data that is used for reference purposes only and that resides entirely outside the application boundary and is maintained by another applications external inputs.

The only EIF of the system consists in the interface with Google Maps services, which was mentioned in the 2.7.2 subsection of the Design Document.
