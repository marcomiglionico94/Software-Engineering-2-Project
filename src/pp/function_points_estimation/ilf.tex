\section{Internal Logical Files (ILFs)}
Internal Logical Files (ILFs) represent a user identifiable group of logically related data that
resides entirely within the application boundary and is maintained through External Inputs.
An internal logical file has the inherent meaning it is internally maintained, it has
some logical structure and it is stored in a file.

The ILFs of our system match closely the database tables, for which we remind at Chapter 2.2.1 of the Design Document.

Using the previously defined tables, this is the count we obtain:

\begin{fpcounttable}{ILF}
User & High & 20 \\
Ride & Average & 12 \\
Car & Low & 7 \\
Safe Area & Low & 4 \\
Power Grid Station + Plug & Low & 3 \\
Operator & High & 18 \\\hline
\fptotal{64}	
\end{fpcounttable}
