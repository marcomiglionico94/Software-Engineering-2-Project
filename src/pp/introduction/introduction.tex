This is the project plan document for the PowerEnJoy project. In this document we will provide an estimate of the complexity of the project and an initial schedule of the work. In the second chapter we will evaluate the functions points, used in chapter three to estimate the cost and effort needed to develop PowerEnJoy, using COCOMO II. In chapter four we will provide an initial work schedule for the project and in chapter five an initial subdivision of the tasks among all the three components of the group. Finally in chapter six we will estimate which risks the project could incur in and how we think to avoid them.
