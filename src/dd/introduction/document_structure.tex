\section{Document Structure}
This document is divided in five chapters:

\begin{description}

	\item [\autoref{ch:introduction}. Introduction:] It provides a general presentation of the Design document and of the system to be developed.

	\item [\autoref{ch:architectural_design}. Architectural Design:]
	It goes into the detail of the architecture design of the system, describing its basic structure and the interactions of the main subsystems.
	It also contains the architectural style and pattern decisions description.

	\item [\autoref{ch:algorithm_design}. Algorithm Design:] It focuses on the definition of the
most important algorithms of the system, independently from their concrete implementation.

	\item [\autoref{ch:ui_design}. User Interface Design:] It shows how the user interfaces of the system will look like and behave, by means of mock-ups and user experience modelling.
	
	\item [\autoref{ch:requirements_traceability}. Requirements Traceability:] It explains how the requirements we have defined in the RASD map to the design elements that we have defined in this document.
