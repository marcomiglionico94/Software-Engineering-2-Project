\section{Scope}
The main goal of the system is to let the users easily look for and reserve a vehicle.

In particular we will present different views of the system representing different levels of abstraction: the user's point of view, an internal sight of the subsystems, their high level interactions and the communication interfaces that they use to interact.

We will describe the chosen architectural styles and pattern, some fundamental algorithms and how our choices are mapped
on the requirements elicited in the RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document).

The software system is divided into three layers: presentation, application and data.
They will be presented in detail in the following chapters.

The architecture has been designed to be easily extensible and maintainable in order to provide new functionalities.
Every component must be conveniently thin and must encapsulate a single functionality, in order to ensure an high cohesion.
The dependency between components is unidirectional and coupling is avoided as much as possible in order to increase the
reusability of the modules.

In order to simplify the system comprehension and to help the developers during the implementation phase, design patterns and architectural styles were used for solving the architectural problems of the system.

The Design Document would also demonstrate how the design will accomplish all the requirements captured in the RASD.
