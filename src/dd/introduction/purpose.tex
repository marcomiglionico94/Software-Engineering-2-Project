\section{Purpose}
This is the Design Document of the PowerEnJoy system. The aim of this
document is to show our design choices and the rationale behind them. 

We will analyse the component of system and how they interact one with the other.
Furthermore, we will show the most important algorithms of the project, in order to suggest the key aspects of their implementation.
Finally, we will add details to the first description of the user interfaces that was given in the RASD.
