\section{Purpose}
This is the Design Document of PowerEnJoy, a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.
The aim of this document is to show our design choices and the rationale behind them. 

We will analyse the components of the system and how they interact between each other.
Furthermore, we will show the most important algorithms of the project, in order to underline the key aspects of their implementation.
Finally, we will add details to the first description of the user interfaces that was described in the RASD.
