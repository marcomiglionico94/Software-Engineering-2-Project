\subsection{Storage of passwords}
Users' passwords are not be stored in plain text, but they are hashed and salted.
In this way it is more difficult for an attacker to retrieve the user information after a possible case of data theft.

In addition to this, the hash algorithm used must be specifically designed to hash passwords, in order to slow down a possible brute force attack.

\subsection{Maps}
In order to have a knowledge of the maps, the system uses the external service Google Maps. We choose it because it is really reliable and its APIs are well documented and maintained.

Of course it was more convenient to adopt an external service like this instead of reconstruct the maps where the PowerEnJoy service will operate.
