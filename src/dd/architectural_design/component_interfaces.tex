\section{Component Interfaces}

\subsection{Logic layer to data storage layer}
The logic layer communicates with the data storage layer via the Java Persistence API (JPA) over standard network protocols.
In this way, the two layers can be deployed both in different tiers or in the same one.

The JPA specification uses an object/relational mapping approach to bridge the gap between an object-oriented model and a relational database in order to focus more on the object model rather than on the actual SQL queries used to access data stores.

\subsection{Logic layer to presentation layer}

The logic layer and the presentation layer communicates with each other over HTTPS protocol. %TODO
