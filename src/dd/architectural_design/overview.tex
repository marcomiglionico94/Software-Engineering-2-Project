\section{Overview}
In this paragraph we provides a comprehensive view over the system components,both at a physical and logical level.
The system will be firstly described at a very high level,showing the different components and how they interact(section 2.2). Then the system will be described and detailed in the paragraph 2.3 following a top-down approach.In section 2.4 we will focus our attention more on the physical level, analysing the deployment of the system on physical tiers and in section 2.5 we will describe the dynamic behaviour of the system. Section 2.6 will focus on the interface between different components of the system.
Finally the design choices and patterns used will be presented and discussed in section 2.7.
