\section{Overview}
In this section we will present the high level components of the system and their interaction:

\begin{description}
\item[Mobile application:] This presentation layer consists in the mobile client. It communicates directly with the application server.
\item[Application Server:] This layer contains all the application logic of the system. All the policies, the algorithms and the computation are performed here. This layer offers a service-oriented interface.
\item[Database:] The data layer is responsible for the data storage and retrieval. It does not implement any application logic. This layer must guarantee ACID properties. 
\item[HandyCar board:] A board to which all the actuators and sensors of the car are connected.
It communicates with the application server, abstracting all the low-level details of the cars.
\item[On-Board tablet:] A tablet that is on board of the vehicles. It used for the communication between the system and the driver, so the tablets communicates with the application server.
\item[PowerEnJoy Operator Program:] A program that the operators of PowerEnJoy can use to interact with the system, for example modifying the safe areas. It communicates with the application server.
\item[External Systems:] There are three external systems: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{External System for Payment:} checks the validity of the payment information and handles the payment process;
		\item \textbf{External System for Driving License Validation:} checks if the driving license informations provided by the user;
		\item \textbf{External System for Maintainers:} signals to the maintainers the unavailable cars;
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

The system is structured in three layers as we can see in picture \ref{fig:layers}.

This design choice makes it possible to deploy the application server and the database on different tiers. It also improves scalability and fault tolerance.

The figure \ref{fig:tiers}, instead, shows the three tiers from a very high level point of view: Client,Server and Data.

The interactions between the main components are shown in the figure \ref{fig:high_components}.

A more detailed description of the three different tiers is shown in picture \ref{fig:tiers_description}.
