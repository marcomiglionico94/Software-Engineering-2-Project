In this chapter we provide a comprehensive view over the system components, both at a physical and logical level.
The system will be firstly described at a very high level, showing the different components and how they interact (section 2.1).
Then the system will be described and detailed in the section 2.2, following a top-down approach.

In section 2.3 we will focus our attention more on the physical level, analysing the deployment of the system on physical tiers, while in section 2.4 we will describe the dynamic behaviour of the system.

Furthermore, section 2.5 will focus on the interface between the different components of the system.
Finally, the design choices and patterns used will be presented and discussed in section 2.6.
