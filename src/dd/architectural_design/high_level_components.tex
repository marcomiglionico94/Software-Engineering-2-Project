\section{High level components and their interaction}
Now we will present the main components of the system:
\begin{description}

\item[Mobile application:] This presentation layer consists in the mobile client. It communicates directly with the application server.
\item[Application Server:] This layer contains all the application logic of the system. All the policies, the algorithms and the computation are performed here. This layer offers a service-oriented interface.
\item[Database:] The data layer is responsible for the data storage and retrieval. It does not implement any application logic. This layer must guarantee ACID properties. 
\end{description}

The system is structured in three layers as we can see in picture \ref{fig:layers}.

This design choice makes it possible to deploy the application server and the database on different tiers. It also improves scalability and fault tolerance.

The figure \ref{fig:tiers}, instead, shows the three tiers from a very high level point of view.

The interactions between the main components are shown in the figure \ref{fig:high_components}.

A more detailed description of the three different tiers is shown in picture \ref{fig:tiers_description}.
