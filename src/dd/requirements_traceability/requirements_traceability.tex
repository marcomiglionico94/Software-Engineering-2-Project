\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Requirement}} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{Design Solution}} \\ \hline
R.1.1 & The system must turn the state of the car from reserved to available if the user did not unlock it within an hour since the moment of the reservation. & CMP: \linebreak Car Manager & The CarManager monitors every reservation and it takes care of doing this.  \\ \hline
R.1.2 & The system must turn the state of the car from available to reserved after the user reserves it. & CMP: Car Manager & The CarManager does it. \\ \hline
R.2.1 & The system must be able to check the position of the user through the GPS position of his mobile phone. & CMP: Car Manager & When a user wants to unlock a car through the mobile app, it does this check. \\ \hline
R.2.2 & The system must be able to show all the available cars, with their current level of battery, within a range of 1 km from the position of the user. & CMP: Car Manager & The function List \textless Car\textgreater{} getAvailableCars(Position center, float radius) does it if the center is the position of the user and if the radius is equal to 1000. \\ \hline
R.2.3 & If there are not any available cars within a range of 1 km from the position of the user the system must notify the user. & CMP: Car Manager & The function List \textless Car\textgreater{} getAvailableCars(Position center, float radius) returns an empty list and the client can advise the user. \\ \hline
R.3.1 & The system must be able to identify a specified location. & CMP: Google Maps API & Through the Google Maps APIs the system is able to do it. \\ \hline
R.3.2 & The system must be able to show all the available cars, with their current level of battery, within a range of 1 km from that specific location. & CMP: Car Manager & The function List \textless Car\textgreater{} getAvailableCars(Position center, float radius) does it if the center is the desired location and if the radius is equal to 1000. \\ \hline
R.3.3 & If there are not any available cars within a range of 1 km from that specific location the system must notify the user. & CMP: Car Manager & The function List \textless Car\textgreater{} getAvailableCars(Position center, float radius) returns an empty list and the client can advise the user. \\ \hline
R.4.1 & The system must be able to check if the user who wants to unlock the car is the same who reserved it. & CMP: Car Manager & The function void unlockCar(String plate) does this check. \\ \hline
R.5.1 & The system must be able to show to the user the position of the safe areas on the map. & CMP: Safe Area Manager & List \textless SafeArea\textgreater{} getSafeAreas() does it. \\ \hline
R.5.2 & The system must notify the user when he/she is inside a safe area. & CMP: Google Maps APIs & Through the Google Maps APIs the client is able to do it. \\ \hline
R.5.3 & The system must end the reservation only when the car is parked in a safe area and the user exits the vehicle. & CMP: Car Manager & The function void endRide() does this check. \\ \hline
R.5.4 & When the reservation ends the system must change the status of the car in available and lock the car. & CMP: Car Manager & The function void endRide() does it. \\ \hline
R.6.1 & The system must be able to calculate the distance between the car and the mobile phone of the user using the GPS positions. & CMP: Car Manager & The Car Manager is able to do it. \\ \hline
R.6.2 & The system must show to the user the option to unlock the car at least when the distance between the car and the mobile phone of the user is less than 6 meters. & Mobile app UI & The Mobile app UI shows this option when the user has a reserved a car. \\ \hline
R.6.3 & The system must be able to unlock the cars remotely. & CMP: Car Manager & The function void unlockCar(String plate) does it. \\ \hline
R.6.4 & The system must be notified when the user enter inside the car. & CMP: Car Manager & The function void unlockCar(String plate) does it. \\ \hline
R.6.5 & The system must be able to lock the car again if the user doesn't enter inside the car within 3 minutes. & CMP: Car Manager & The Car Manager does it. \\ \hline
R.7.1 & The system must be able to calculate the current fee with respect to the amount of money per minute defined by the company. & CMP: Fee Manager & The Fee Manager does it. \\ \hline
R.7.2 & The system must be able to show on the tablet present on the car the current fee that the user has to pay. & Fee Manager & The function float getFeeWithVariation(String ID) can send the current fee to the car tablet. \\ \hline
R.8.1 & The system must be able to show to the user the position of the power grid station. & Safe Area Manager & The function List \textless Position\textgreater{} getPowerGridStations() does it. \\ \hline
R.8.2 & The system must be able to show to the user the number of free plugs in every power grid station. & Safe Area Manager & The function int getFreePlugsNumber(Position powerGridStationCenter) does it. \\ \hline
R.9.1 & The system must allow only the users that has not been banned to search for a car. & Car Manager & The Car Manager does this check. \\ \hline
R.9.2 & The system must allow only the users that has not been banned to reserve a car. & Car Manager & The Car Manager does this check. \\ \hline
R.9.3 & The system must be able to know the result of the payment operation. & ... & .... \\ \hline
