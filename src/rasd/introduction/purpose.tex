\section{Purpose}
The purpose is to develop a digital management system for a car-sharing service called PowerEnJoy that exclusively employs electric cars. The main goal is to let the users easily look for and reserve a vehicle a car.

Users must be able to find the locations of available cars within a certain distance from their current location or from a specified address and among the found vehicles, they must be able to reserve a single car for up to one hour before they pick it up.

Users must pay a fee if they do not pick up the car that they reserved and receive discounts if they behave correctly, for example if they took at least two other passengers onto the car or if the car is left with no more than 50\% of the battery empty.

In addition to this, users can enable the "money saving option" and, depending on their destination and the availability of power plugs, the system will communicate them a station where to leave the car to get a discount.
