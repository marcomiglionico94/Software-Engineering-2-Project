\section{Description of the problem}
The project is about a digital management system for a car sharing service called PowerEnJoy that exclusively employs electric cars. The only target of the system are the clients.
 
The user is allowed to look for and book a vehicle through two main channels:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the website
	\item the mobile app.
\end{enumerate}

Every car is equipped with a geo-localization system that allows to localize it through the GPS signal.
The user is able to find the nearest available car using his current position given by the mobile app.
Alternatively, he can look for a vehicle in a different zone specifying the address.

In order to use the service, the users must be able to register to the system by providing their credentials, the driving license and the payment information.


The main purpose of the system is to provide a way to move around the city in a more convenient and simple way compared to the actual competitors. Another aim of the system is to encourage, with some discounts, the virtuous behavior of the users and the respect for the environment.
