Here some possible scenarios where to use the service.
\section{Scenario 1}
Al has to come back home and there are no more bus available. He opens the PowerEnjoy app on his smartphone. The app, using the phone GPS, shows Al all the cars close to him. Al finds a car 50m close and books it. Once he reaches it he requires the system to open it. Once he enters he submit his password on car touch screen and starts the car. Al find the safe area nearest his house, parks the car there and ends the rent. The system calculate the cost of the rent and credits it to Al's account.
\section{Scenario 2}
Al, John and Jack has to go to the airport. They meet at Al's house. Al finds and books a car. They reach the car and enter into. Car sensor counts two passengers other the driver. When the rent ends a discount of 10% will applied before the system would credits the rent cost to Al's account.
\section{Scenario 3}
Similar to scenario 2 Al, John and Jack go to the airport with the same car. Once they enter into the car, Al selects the money saving option before they start moving. The system shows him the position of the power grid stations near their destination and Al picks up one. Once Al parks and connects the car to the power grid a discount of 40\% will applied to the total rent cost (10\% because there were two passenger other the diver and 30\% because Al connected the car to the power grid).
\section{Scenario 4}
Similar to scenario 2 Al, John and Jack go to the airport with the same car and Al selects the money saving option before they start moving. However they are late and Al does not connect the car to the power grid even though he has parked in the power grid station. At the end only a discount of 10\% will applied, because there were two passengers other the driver.
\section{Scenario 5}
John and Jack book a car to go to the mall. There is not a safe area where to park near the mall so they park in the mall parking. The system will warn them that there it is not possible to end the rent but they can activate the parking mode. John and Jack activate it and they close the car. Once they end they return to the car and come back home, finding for a safe area where to end the rent.
\section{Scenario 6}
Carl decide to have an excursion and rents a car to go to the lake. There is not a safe area near the lake so he activates the parking mode. At the end of the day he decides to come back home with the train leaving the car without ending the rent. 24 hours after the rent start the system will end the rent, will credit to Carl the full amount of rent cost and a fine and will close Carl account.
\section{Scenario 7}
Carl, with his friend Joe and Debby, has some appointment through the city and they decide to rent a car. At some point he realizes the car has only 10\% power left and so he parks it in the nearest safe area and ends the rent. The system will credits Carl's account to the rent cost increased of 20\%. This is why he gained a discount of 10\% because there where two passengers and a fine of 30\% because he did not connect to the power grid a car with 10\% battery left.
