\section{Product prespective}
% Describes external interfaces: system, user, hardware, software; also operations and site adaptation, and hardware constraints.
% It defines the boundaries of the system. Further details on the shared phenomena and a domain model (class diagrams, and statecharts)

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
In the system there are the following interfaces:
\begin{description}
	\item [Broken button:] a button that is present in every car and can be pressed by the user to report that there something wrong with the mechanical aspects of the car;
	\item [GPS:] it's used to track the position of cars and users;
