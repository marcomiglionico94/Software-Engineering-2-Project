\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{description}
	\item [Panic button:] when the panic button is pressed the HandyCar board must send a message to the system to notify that in that car there is something wrong. The message must contain an ID that identifies the car from which it was pressed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mobile app must run on both Android 4.0.3+ and IOS 8+.
\item The payment gateway and the motorization gateway has to communicate via HTTPS in order to ensure security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
The mobile app, the tablet in the car, the HandyCar Board and the remote system itself communicate with each other through HTTPS requests (port 443). In this way we ensure that everything that is sent on the internet is encrypted.
